1
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,960
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,350
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,855
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:52,320
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,780
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,910
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,375
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,315
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,400
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,075
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,370
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,205
There you go.

13
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,215
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:58,680
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:02,890
- They really are--
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,065
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,023
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,486
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,699
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:37,217
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.
